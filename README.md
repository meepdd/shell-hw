### How do I use the script?

- Download two .txt files and randexpelled.sh 
- Permission to run the script is given 
- Runs the script, generates names in expelled_surnames and displays images in the expelled folder

The detailed work of the script is described in the code itself



### Flaws:

There is no correct declension of the verb "expelled"


### As a final remark:
